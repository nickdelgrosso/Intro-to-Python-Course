    "That's what \"For-each\" loops (in Python, just called \"For\" loops) are meant to help with.  In a \"For-each\" loop, you specify how many times the loop will occur before starting the loop, and even set the variable names you'll be using in the header.  This makes a big difference in readability!  Let's take a look:\n",

    "print(value * 2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Iterators** and **Iterables (types that can become an Iterator)** are super useful for for-loops, and there are many Python functions that make them for you.  The most important one is the **range()** function, which produces integers between two values.  For example:\n",
